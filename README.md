# ConfluenceRestClient

A simple Java Client to communicate with the Confluence Rest API.

## Version

`SNAPSHOT-1.0` is Work in Progress...

## Usage

Create a new instance of ConfluenceRestClient and call the method 'connect()'.
You need the URI of the Confluence Server an your login credentials.

```java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
ConfluenceRestClient confluenceClient = new ConfluenceRestClient(executorService);
URI confluenceBaseUri = new URI("hhtps://example.com);
confluenceClient.connect(confluenceBaseUri, "username", "password");
```

Then you get seperated clients for the different entities:

* SpaceClient
* UserClient
* ContentClient

```java
ContentClient contentClient = confluenceClient.getContentClient();
List<String> expand = new ArrayList<>();
expand.add(ExpandField.BODY_VIEW.getName());
expand.add(ExpandField.BODY_STORAGE.getName());
Future<ContentBean> future = contentClient.getContentById(123456, 0, expand);
ContentBean content = future.get();
...
```
